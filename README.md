# Machine Learning
Coursera's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Stanford University provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
* Supervised learning
  - parametric/non-parametric algorithms
  - support vector machines with kernels
  - neural networks
* Unsupervised learning 
  - clustering
  - dimensionality reduction
  - recommender systems
  - deep learning
* Best practices in machine learning
  - bias/variance theory
  - innovation process in machine learning and AI 
  
The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
